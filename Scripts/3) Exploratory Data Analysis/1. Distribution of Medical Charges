#HISTOGRAM

ggplot(df, aes(x = charges)) +
#This initializes the plot with the dataset df.
#aes(x = charges) means you're mapping the variable charges from the dataframe df to the x-axis.

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
#geom_histogram() adds a histogram layer to the plot.
#binwidth = 2000 means that the data will be grouped into bins of width 2000 units (for example, $2000 if charges are in dollars).
#fill = "skyblue" sets the color filling the bars to a light blue.
#color = "black" gives each bar a black border.

  labs(title = "Distribution of Medical Charges", x = "Charges", y = "Count")
#This sets the labels: 
#Title of the plot: "Distribution of Medical Charges"
#x-axis label: "Charges"
#y-axis label: "Count" (the number of observations in each bin)
