#CORRELATION MATRIX
# Encode categorical variables for correlation

df_numeric <- df %>%
  mutate(sex = as.numeric(sex),
         smoker = as.numeric(smoker),
         region = as.numeric(region))
#Creating a new dataframe df_numeric based on df.
#Using mutate(), convert categorical variables into numeric values.
#as.numeric() transforms factor or character variables into numbers.
#This step is necessary because correlation calculations require numeric data.

corr_matrix <- cor(df_numeric)
#Calculates the correlation matrix of the numeric dataframe.
#This matrix shows the pairwise correlation coefficients between all variables.

corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.col = "black", addCoef.col = "black")
#Uses the corrplot package to visualize the correlation matrix.
#method = "color" displays correlations as colored tiles (gradient colors represent the strength and direction of correlation).
#type = "upper" shows only the upper triangle of the matrix (since it's symmetric, this avoids redundancy).
#tl.col = "black" colors the text labels (variable names) in black.
#addCoef.col = "black" adds the numeric correlation coefficients on the plot in black font.
