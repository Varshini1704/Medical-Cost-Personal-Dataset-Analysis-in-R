#BOX PLOT

ggplot(df, aes(x = smoker, y = charges, fill = smoker)) +
#This starts a plot using your dataframe df.
#x = smoker: The x-axis will show the variable smoker.
#y = charges: The y-axis shows the charges variable.
#fill = smoker: The color fill inside the boxplots will be based on the smoking status, so each boxplot will be colored differently according to smoker/non-smoker.

  geom_boxplot() +
#This adds boxplots to the plot.
#Each boxplot summarizes the distribution of charges for each category of smoker.
#A boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

  labs(title = "Charges by Smoking Status", y = "Charges")
#Adds the title: "Charges by Smoking Status"
#Labels the y-axis as "Charges"
#No label specified for the x-axis, so it defaults to smoker.
