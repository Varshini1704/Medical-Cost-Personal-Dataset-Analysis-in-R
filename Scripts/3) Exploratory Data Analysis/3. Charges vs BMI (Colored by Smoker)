#SCATTER PLOT

ggplot(df, aes(x = bmi, y = charges, color = smoker)) +
#Creates a scatter plot using data from df.
#x = bmi: Body Mass Index on the x-axis.
#y = charges: Medical charges on the y-axis.
#color = smoker: Points will be colored differently depending on whether the person is a smoker or not.

  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
#Adds scatter plot points.
#alpha = 0.6 makes points semi-transparent (60% opacity), which helps when points overlap.

  labs(title = "BMI vs Charges by Smoking Status")
#Adds a title to the plot.
#Axis labels default to the variable names (bmi and charges).
